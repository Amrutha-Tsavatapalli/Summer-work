#  Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

This project is part of my **Week 1 ACM Summer Vacation Work**.  
The goal is to build a  model that can detect **diseases in tomato leaves** based on image classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used is from **Kaggle**, containing images of tomato leaves categorized into different disease types such as:

- Early Blight  
- Late Blight  
- Yellow Leaf Curl Virus  
- Leaf Mold  
- and Healthy Leaves

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
  
2. **Model Building**  
   
3. **Training & Evaluation**  
  
4. **Prediction**
